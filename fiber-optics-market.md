<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fiber Optics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Multi-Mode Fiber Optics</li><li>Single-Mode Fiber Optics</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fiber optics market comprises two primary types: Multi-Mode Fiber Optics and Single-Mode Fiber Optics. Multi-Mode Fiber Optics, designed for short-distance data transmission, use a larger core diameter to allow multiple light paths, making it cost-effective for local networks. In contrast, Single-Mode Fiber Optics feature a smaller core, enabling long-distance communication by allowing only one light path, which reduces signal loss and increases bandwidth capacity. Both types cater to diverse applications, from data centers to telecommunications.</p></p>
