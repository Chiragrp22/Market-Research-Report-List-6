<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Insulin Infusion Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed-Loop</li><li>Open-Loop</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The insulin infusion pumps market is primarily segmented into closed-loop and open-loop systems. Closed-loop systems, or artificial pancreas systems, automatically adjust insulin delivery based on continuous glucose monitoring, providing precise control with minimal user intervention. In contrast, open-loop systems require users to manually monitor glucose levels and adjust insulin delivery accordingly. Both types cater to individuals with diabetes, but closed-loop systems offer a more automated and potentially safer solution, while open-loop systems provide more user control and flexibility.</p></p>
