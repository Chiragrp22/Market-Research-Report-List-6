<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High Speed CMOS Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Front-illuminated (FI) CMOS</li><li>Backside-illuminated (BSI) CMOS sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The high-speed CMOS sensor market includes two primary types: Front-Illuminated (FI) and Backside-Illuminated (BSI) CMOS sensors. FI CMOS sensors capture light directly through the sensor’s front surface but can struggle with low-light conditions due to light blockage by circuit elements. Conversely, BSI CMOS sensors offer greater light sensitivity by allowing light to enter from the back, enhancing image quality in low-light situations. This makes BSI sensors increasingly popular in applications requiring high-speed imaging and superior performance.</p></p>
