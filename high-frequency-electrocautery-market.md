<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High Frequency Electrocautery Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monopolar Circuit</li><li>Bipolar Circuit</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The High Frequency Electrocautery market is primarily categorized into monopolar and bipolar circuits. Monopolar circuits utilize a single active electrode that delivers high-frequency current through the patient's body to a grounding pad. This method is often used for larger surgical procedures. In contrast, bipolar circuits consist of two electrodes that deliver current between them, minimizing tissue damage and providing more precise cutting and coagulation. Both types cater to different surgical needs, with distinct benefits in efficiency and safety.</p></p>
