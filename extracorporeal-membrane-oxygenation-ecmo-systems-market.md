<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>VA (Veno-Arterial) ECMO</li><li>VV (Veno-Venous) ECMO</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) Systems are life-saving devices used to provide temporary support to patients with severe respiratory or cardiac failure. There are two main types of ECMO systems: VA (Veno-Arterial) ECMO and VV (Veno-Venous) ECMO. VA ECMO provides support to both the heart and lungs by removing oxygen-poor blood from a vein, oxygenating it, and returning it to an artery. VV ECMO, on the other hand, only supports the lungs by removing blood from a vein, oxygenating it, and returning it to the same vein.</p></p>
