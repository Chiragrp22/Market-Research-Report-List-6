<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Seismic Simulators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Uniaxial Seismic Simulators</li><li>Biaxial Seismic Simulators</li><li>6DOF Seismic Simulators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Seismic simulators are categorized into three main types based on their motion capabilities. Uniaxial seismic simulators replicate ground motion in a single direction, primarily used for simpler testing scenarios. Biaxial seismic simulators allow for two-dimensional motion, offering a more comprehensive assessment of structural responses. In contrast, 6DOF (degrees of freedom) seismic simulators simulate motion across all three spatial dimensions, mimicking real-world seismic events, and providing detailed insights into the behavior of structures during earthquakes.</p></p>
