<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Barrier Membranes in Dentistry Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable Membrane</li><li>Non-absorbable Membrane</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Barrier membranes in dentistry are crucial for procedures like guided tissue regeneration and dental implant placement. The market is divided into two main types: absorbable and non-absorbable membranes. Absorbable membranes, made from materials like collagen or synthetic polymers, dissolve naturally over time, eliminating the need for a second surgery. Non-absorbable membranes, typically composed of materials like PTFE, provide long-lasting support but require removal after healing. Both types serve to protect and facilitate the desired tissue regeneration in dental applications.</p></p>
