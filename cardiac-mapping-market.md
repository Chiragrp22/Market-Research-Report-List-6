<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardiac Mapping Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Cardiac mapping systems</li><li>Non-contact Cardiac mapping systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cardiac mapping encompasses two main types: contact and non-contact systems. Contact cardiac mapping systems involve direct contact with the heart tissue using catheters equipped with electrodes, providing precise local electrical activity and detailed maps of arrhythmia. In contrast, non-contact cardiac mapping systems use magnetic or electromagnetic fields to gather data from the heart without direct physical contact. This method offers a broader view of the electrical activity, facilitating a comprehensive assessment of cardiac arrhythmias while reducing potential risks associated with invasive procedures.</p></p>
