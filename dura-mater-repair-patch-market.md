<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dura Mater Repair Patch Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable</li><li>Non-absorbable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The dura mater repair patch market is divided into absorbable and non-absorbable types. Absorbable patches gradually dissolve in the body, promoting natural healing over time and eliminating the need for subsequent surgical removal. They are often made from biocompatible materials that mimic the properties of human tissue. In contrast, non-absorbable patches are designed to remain permanently in place, providing long-term structural support and strength. Both types are crucial for surgical procedures involving the dura mater, facilitating effective recovery.</p></p>
