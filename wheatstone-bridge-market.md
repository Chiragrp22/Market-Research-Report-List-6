<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wheatstone Bridge Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Balanced Bridge</li><li>Unbalanced Bridge</li></ul></p>
<p><p>A Wheatstone Bridge is a type of circuit used to measure resistance or electrical impedance. In a Balanced Bridge market, the four resistors are equal in value, resulting in a balanced condition where no current flows through the galvanometer. In an Unbalanced Bridge market, the resistors have different values, causing an imbalance and resulting in current flowing through the galvanometer indicating a difference in resistance. Balanced Bridge markets are typically used for precise measurements, while Unbalanced Bridge markets are used for detecting changes or variations.</p></p>
