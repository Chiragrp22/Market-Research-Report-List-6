<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Home Lighting Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Off-grid Solar</li><li>Grid-tied Solar</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Solar Home Lighting Equipment market comprises two main types: off-grid solar and grid-tied solar systems. Off-grid solar solutions operate independently from utility power, making them ideal for remote areas without electricity access. They typically include solar panels, batteries, and inverters. In contrast, grid-tied solar systems connect to the local power grid, allowing homeowners to use solar energy while remaining connected to the utility. This setup enables net metering and reduces reliance on fossil fuels, while often lowering electricity costs.</p></p>
