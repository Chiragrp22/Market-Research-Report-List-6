<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Linear Resonant Actuator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rectengular Linear Resonant Actuator</li><li>Coin Type Linear Resonanot Actuator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Linear Resonant Actuators (LRAs) are commonly found in two main types in the market. The rectangular LRA is larger in size and is ideal for applications where a stronger haptic feedback is needed. On the other hand, the coin type LRA is smaller and more compact, making it suitable for devices with limited space. Both types of LRAs operate on the same principle of vibrating at a specific resonant frequency to generate haptic feedback, but they differ in size and application suitability.</p></p>
