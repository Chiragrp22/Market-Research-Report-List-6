<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Submerged Arc Welded Pipe Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>LSAW Pipe</li><li>SSAW Pipe</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Submerged Arc Welded Pipe market primarily consists of two types: LSAW (Longitudinal Submerged Arc Welded) and SSAW (Spiral Submerged Arc Welded) pipes. LSAW pipes are produced by rolling flat steel plates and welding them in a longitudinal manner, providing high strength and reliability, ideal for high-pressure applications. SSAW pipes, on the other hand, are made by spiral-welding steel strips, allowing for greater flexibility in diameter and wall thickness, making them suitable for various construction projects and infrastructure needs.</p></p>
