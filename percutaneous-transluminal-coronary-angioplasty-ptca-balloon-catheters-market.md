<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA) Balloon Catheters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Normal Balloon Catheter</li><li>Drug Eluting Balloon Catheter</li><li>Cutting Balloon Catheter</li><li>Scoring Balloon Catheter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The PTCA balloon catheters market comprises several types tailored for coronary angioplasty procedures. Normal balloon catheters are standard devices used to expand narrowed arteries. Drug-eluting balloon catheters release medication to prevent restenosis post-procedure. Cutting balloon catheters feature sharp blades to score plaque while dilating the artery, enhancing effectiveness in tough lesions. Scoring balloon catheters utilize micro-cutting technology to facilitate arterial enlargement with reduced force, minimizing tissue damage. Each type serves specific clinical needs in coronary interventions.</p></p>
