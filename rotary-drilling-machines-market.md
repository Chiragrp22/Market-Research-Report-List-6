<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotary Drilling Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Normal Circulation</li><li>Reverse Circulation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The rotary drilling machines market encompasses two main types: normal circulation and reverse circulation. Normal circulation drilling utilizes a fluid that is pumped down through the drill string, flushing cuttings back up to the surface. This method is often used for shallow wells and soft formations. Conversely, reverse circulation drilling blasts air or drilling fluid down the annulus while returning cuttings through the center of the pipe. This technique is more efficient for deeper or harder formations, enhancing drilling speed and accuracy.</p></p>
