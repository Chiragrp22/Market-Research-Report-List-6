<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Prosthetic Heart Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Transcatheter Heart Valves</li><li>Tissue Heart Valves</li><li>Mechanical Heart Valves</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The prosthetic heart valves market comprises three main types: transcatheter heart valves, tissue heart valves, and mechanical heart valves. Transcatheter heart valves are minimally invasive, allowing for replacement through catheterization, ideal for high-risk patients. Tissue heart valves are made from biological materials, offering a natural function but typically requiring replacement after 10-15 years. Mechanical heart valves, made of durable materials, last longer but necessitate lifelong anticoagulation therapy due to the risk of blood clots. Each type caters to specific patient needs and conditions.</p></p>
