<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyester Geogrid Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Biaxial Tension</li><li>Uniaxial Tension</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The polyester geogrid market is categorized into two main types based on their tension characteristics: biaxial tension and uniaxial tension. Biaxial tension geogrids are designed to provide strength in both horizontal and vertical directions, making them suitable for applications like pavement reinforcement and soil stabilization. Conversely, uniaxial tension geogrids offer enhanced strength primarily in one direction, ideal for retaining walls and slope stabilization. Both types enhance structural integrity and durability in civil engineering projects.</p></p>
