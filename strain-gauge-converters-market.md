<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Strain Gauge Converters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Current Output</li><li>Voltage Output</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Strain gauge converters are commonly classified into two types based on their output signal: Current Output and Voltage Output. Current output strain gauge converters provide a current signal that is directly proportional to the applied strain, making it more immune to electrical noise and suitable for long-distance transmission. On the other hand, voltage output strain gauge converters produce a voltage signal that is a linear function of the applied strain, making them more compatible with most data acquisition systems and easier to integrate into existing setups.</p></p>
