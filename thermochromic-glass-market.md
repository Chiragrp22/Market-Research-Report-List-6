<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermochromic Glass Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Color Change Temperature:28℃</li><li>Color Change Temperature:32℃</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The thermochromic glass market is segmented based on color change temperatures, primarily into two categories: color change temperature at 28℃ and 32℃. Glass that changes color at 28℃ is designed for environments with slightly lower temperature thresholds, providing a cooling effect as indoor temperatures rise. In contrast, the 32℃ variant is ideal for regions with higher thermal exposure, becoming opaque or tinted when temperatures exceed this level, thereby enhancing energy efficiency and indoor comfort. Both types offer innovative solutions for energy management and aesthetic purposes.</p></p>
